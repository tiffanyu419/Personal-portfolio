 <h4>The Swarthmore Student Government serves
   as the bridge between the student body and
   the administration. Our main
   responsibilities are to respond to campus
   wide situations, push up and discuss
   legislative bills written by students and
   serve as the student body representative 
   on administration decisions. I was elected
   as an at-large senator my sophomore year 
   and as the Chair of The Environmental 
   Impact Committee my junior year by the
   entire student body. Below are some of 
   the many projects that I worked on in the
   past two years.

    <h4> Mountain Justice is an activisim 
      group that have been urging our college
      to divest since its founding in 2010.
      The administration has had 
      many closed door conversations with 
      Mountain Justice but both parties have 
      failed to reach a consensus. 
      In the recent years, 
      Mountain Justice started two sit-ins 
      and also passed a referedum through 
      SGO, all of which the administration
      responded negatively to. With tensions 
      running high, SGO decided to host a 
      forum to bring this conversation to 
      the whole campus, bringing in students 
      and faculty with different opinions 
      into a stagnant conversation. I 
      invited an off campus, neutral
      regulator and collected and summarized 
      questions from the whole 
      student body, we created a platform
      where attending students could be 
      educated about the issue and bring in 
      new opinions and ideas 
      into the conversation.

    <h4> One of the responsibilities the 
    student government has is 
    to push bills and resond to on campus
    events. In the past year, we pushed a 
    bill to change the credit non credit 
    policy of our school and debated the 
    usefulness of adding a diversity 
    requirement into our curriculum. Other
    discussions we held included response 
    to hate crimes committed on campus and
    the Divestment Referendum mentioned 
    above. To find out more about our work,
